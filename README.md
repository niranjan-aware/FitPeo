# Healthcare Dashboard - React Static Display

Welcome to my Healthcare Dashboard project — 

## STACK
# React + Vite + tailwindCSS

# UI Design Characteristics

🌀 Smooth Transition Effects

All interactive components like buttons, cards, and inputs feature subtle transitions using Tailwind's transition, duration, and ease utilities.

🧊 Neumorphic Look & Feel

Components like buttons and input fields are styled using soft shadows and rounded edges to mimic a neumorphic (soft UI) aesthetic.


📱 Fully Responsive Design

Layouts and components are built mobile-first and adapt seamlessly to tablets and desktops using Tailwind's responsive utility classes (sm:, md:, lg:).
